Getting Laravel Ready
=====================

An introduction to Laravel and some modern PHP practices.

This talk was planned to tag along with the Eric Jones Content Management workshop. The goal of this session was to get attendees on par with the requirements to work with Laravel and to have a working install that they could use throughout the rest of the Conference, as well as in their future development workflows.

I be walked participants through the basics of getting a machine ready to work with Laravel via composer and the latest stable release of PHP. We did this through the comfort Vagrant and provided a pre-build vagrant box to participants at the end of the session if they would like. We also did our best to bring those with an existing environment up to speed with the requirements to get started with Laravel.

Along with a working installation, we be walked through the configurability of Laravel as well as setting some defaults of our own. This was be side-chained with a brief overview of environments, the importance of providers, and maintaining a secure configuration within your production environment.
